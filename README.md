# NumQuickSort
User enters numbers until they type stop. Numbers get printed to console in the order they were entered. 
The list then gets sorted by the quick sort algorithm and then gets printed out again, but this time in ascending order. 

I have made two separate working versions:
- One shuffles through the original array
- One creates two new arrays each time and then returns the result back into the original array
